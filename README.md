## What is RegX?

RegX is a system that allows patients to demonstrate their adherence to their pharmaceutical regimen without video meetings with their doctors. Pharmacies can generate RegX QR codes from our system, which they can then print and attach to boxes of prescribed medication. The QR codes can be printed, and then attached to perscriptions as stickers, by the same means pharmacies use to apply regimen information to perscriptions.<br /><br />
To demonstrate their regimen adherence, patients scan these QR codes when they take their medication. Doctors can review these scans, and select whether patients must upload a video of them taking their medication when they scan a QR. If the latter is so, when a patient scans one of our QR codes they will be brought to a video upload screen.<br /><br />
RegX simultaneously works as a means to prevent medical conflicts: If a patient accidently scans medication that could induce a medical conflict, they are promptly warned of the danger.<br /><br />
As an additonal feature, using computer vision technology, the videos for doctors to review are pre-categorised by their likelihood to ential a person ingesting medication - lessoning the workload of reviewing on doctors.
