# RegX: The Drug Regimen Tracker

RegX is a system that allows patients to demonstrate their adherence to their pharmacutical regimen without video meetings with their doctors. Pharmacies can generate QR codes from our system, which they can print on their sticker labels and attach to boxes of prescribed medication. To demonstrate their adherence to their regimen, patients scan these QR codes when they are to take their medication. Doctors can mandate patients to have to upload videos of them taking their medication. If this is so, when a patient scans one of our QR codes they will be brought to a video upload screen. Doctors can review the QR scans and video uploads of their patients through our system. Using computer vision, the videos for doctors to review are pre-categorised by their likelihood to ential a person ingesting medication. If a patient accidently scans a medication and could induce a medical conflict, they are promptly warned of the danger.
